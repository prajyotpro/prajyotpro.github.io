It is self **care**, it is self **love**. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been more than **4 years** I‚Äôve been working as a **Software Developer**. So here I write with my own personal experiences about how I **balance** my daily life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first started working as a Software Developer my main goals were to learn how to be a **professional**. What I meant by being professional is following defined standards of working and writing code. First 2 years of my work experience had a steep learning curve. As a junior developer I was learning to write strict, optimised and flexible **code**. But learning how to write a software code with a given guidance was very important. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My work timing used to start from **9:00** to **18:00**, but I used to stay late putting more effort to get things right. Then it was very much needed for me to be at the level where I wanted to be, to achieve my personal goals (and companies as well).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe everyone has a potential to achieve their **targets**, sometimes slow, at times fast ‚Äì practise, stress, healing makes us stronger ‚Äì It is the way of **life**. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But then just work, like working at the table whole day got me **fat**. I gained almost **91 kgs** ‚Äì that is the max I‚Äôve been till now. I felt heavy, not so flexible, yet I used to insist writing flexible code, but that didn‚Äôt help my body. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me tell you guys ‚Äì I used to play a lot of sports when in college and university. I represented my college in table tennis, cricket. Also a basketball and football enthusiast. And hell yeah! I used to workout. But then I had to play my priority games once I started working.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what‚Äôs the deal now? Interestingly, I try to follow my daily routine. It is necessary to keep your body and mind clean and fit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically it consist of nothing special, just a strict and focused plan. </span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wake up at 7 ‚Äì without your phone.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshen up ‚Äì keep your mind relaxed ‚Äì close your eyes and relax for a minute. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the coffee and breakfast ready. My breakfast feels incomplete without eggs. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">I leave for work by 9:20 (it takes 5 mins for me to travel to my current workplace)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh you need to read my post on what I like to do at work ‚Äì </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Also I try to leave my work on time now, but then it also depends on the workload. So max by 19:00.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Go home, feel fresh take a shot of coffee and fire the gym.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Be back home by 21:00-21:30. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshen up ‚Äì Cook my dinner ‚Äì now this is the best part of the day. Very decisive and something to feel good about ending the day, cause love food. And I believe you love it too.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before bed I try to spend my time on research, reading or social ‚Äì it depends on what‚Äôs active.</span>

Joining gym, staying healthy &amp; fit not only boosted my health, but also made be feel confident about my self in every approach of life. Now I weigh **75 kg** (healthy). I feel good about my body, I feel good about my self. ‚Äú**I love myself**‚Äù ‚Äì is what we all want to achieve in life, isn‚Äôt it ?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That sums up my day. Oh yes! I love **weekends**. That‚Äôs the time I like to meet people, take chill on a beach, go swimming, may be cycling ‚Äì lots of activities to do. And we need to make time for it üôÇ </span>
