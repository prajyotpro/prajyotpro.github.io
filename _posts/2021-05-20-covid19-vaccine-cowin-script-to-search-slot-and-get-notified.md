<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix"></span> <span class="rt-time">2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">min read</span></span>I have been trying to book a slot on the Co-WIN web application, and it always says booked! â€“ do you feel the same as me?

**What is CoWIN?**   
Let us understand **eVIN** (electronic vaccine intelligence network). India has been using eVIN for real-time information on vaccine stocks and flows, and storage temperatures across all cold chain points. **CoWIN** is an extension of eVIN, it is a cloud-based web application use for managing, monitoring, and evaluating Covid-19 vaccination in India.

**CoWIN API**  
CoWIN has launched public APIâ€™s which can be used by any third party to find and download vaccine appointments.  
  
You may refer to full API documentation on **API Setu**: <https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2>

**Why the script?**  
If you have used the CoWIN portal, we all know the login to the portal has a login session duration and it will log you out at some point in time.   
Instead of following the login steps every time, which was a tedious process. I came up writing this script.  
  
The script allows me to set various search options and also send a notification on different channels. I have been using Email (**Mailgun**) and **Slack**. For you can configure and add more channels as you desire.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">![](https://www.prajyotkhandeparkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pexels-cottonbro-3952238.jpg)</figure></div>### Dive in

The code is written in JavaScript and you can run it on node.js

**Why Javascript?** â€“ so that any developer can adapt and make changes to it  
  
Repository Link: [https://github.com/prajyotpro/cowin\_vaccine\_notifier](https://github.com/prajyotpro/cowin_vaccine_notifier)

**The Setup**  
â€“ Install node.js  
â€“ git clone https://github.com/prajyotpro/cowin\_vaccine\_notifier.git  
â€“ cd cowin\_vaccine\_notifier  
â€“ cp .env\_example .env  
â€“ add configuration to .env

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
ENABLE_MAILGUN=false
MAILGUN_API_KEY=mailgun api key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mailgun domain
MAILGUN_RECEIPIENTS=["email1@example.com", "email2@example.com"]

ENABLE_SLACK=true
SLACK_HOOK_URL=slack web hook
```
```

â€“ script parameters

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
--date DD-MM-YYYY // mandatory, default current date
--district 151 // district id - required if no pincode, default - 151
--pincode 403001 // pincode - required if no district
--age 18 // age limit (18,45), default - 18
--dose 1 // dose (1,2), default - 1
```
```

### Running the script

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
node index.js --date 20-05-2021 --district 151 --age 18 --dose 1
```
```

Data Output:

Iâ€™ve set up a notification hook on a covid channel.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://www.prajyotkhandeparkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-20-at-11.30.42-PM-1024x531.png)</figure>## Now what? How do I book an appointment?

Running the script every moment does not make sense? So I have setup a cronjob along with a shell command:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
*/1 * * * * /bin/sh /Users/prajyot/Projects/prajyot/cowin_vaccine_notifier/script.sh
```
```

Once I received slack notification I try to book on the [CoWIN web portal](https://selfregistration.cowin.gov.in/),   
Oh no! go ahead make it automated, feel free to add to the script and auto book an appointment â€“ explore and explode ðŸ™‚
