Have you heard the saying “Sunday ho ya Monday roz khao ande!”? – it goes like having eggs everyday. But why?

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://www.prajyotkhandeparkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-dhaya-eddine-bentaleb-5277135.jpg)</figure>Study says eggs have numerous health benefits, but let me share a few of them which caught my attention in the past few years!

Egg has the highest health benefit, an average serving of 2 eggs contains:

- 82% of your daily vitamin D requirements
- 50% of your daily folate requirements
- 25% of your daily riboflavin (Vitamin B2) requirements
- 40% of your daily selenium requirements

Perfect protein source:  
Proteins are the building blocks of life, essential for the strength and repair of muscle and tissue – with one single egg containing about 6.3 grams of the highest-quality protein available.

The whole egg helps in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels – “good” cholesterol ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23021013/))

Omega3 helps in lowering (LDL) – “bad” cholesterol.

Eggs have been an essential part of my daily morning breakfast and I love it! Let’s dig in few easy to make recipes I have in my list:
