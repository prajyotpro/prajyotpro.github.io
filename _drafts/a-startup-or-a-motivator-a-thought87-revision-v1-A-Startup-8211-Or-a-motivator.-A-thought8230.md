It’s like you see how a **startup** can not progress better. And you try to think.. why?

<div><div>My **professors** always told us. It is not all about working in bigger **MNC’s**, but it is best to work at a startup.</div></div><div>![](https://www.prajyotkhandeparkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/office-3295556_640.jpg)</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>And I always used to think why? After all it is all about learning skills to be a good **developer**.. ?

<div></div><div></div>But then I realise a little now, that all they meant was about the experience you gain. Not only your coding skills but how to think about refining a **product** – a **startup**.

<div></div><div></div>From my point I see all the great companies, how they have grown like the giants. All are product. A start up is a product , it is yours to launch and keep it going till it gets refined – just how smooth a **CBR\*** feels like.

<div></div><div></div>They have grown with a **structure**, just like how **MongoDB** handles uncertain unstructured data and form quick reports that can be used to plan a structure to build better.

<div></div><div></div><div></div><div>![](https://www.prajyotkhandeparkar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ribblehead-viaduct-2443085_640.jpg)</div><div></div><div></div>A **structure** from – a developer structuring the code – a team leader structuring the team – a project manager structuring the project – to the **human resource** structuring all these talented **nuts** at one place!

<div></div><div></div>And thus flows the refined experience from the top – to the project manager with his refined skills to structure the project – to a team lead to lead the team with fine skills in coding and balancing the team with a structure of growth and performance – a developer to implement better structured code.

<div></div><div></div>And there you see the flow of happiness from the bottom. From a developer – to the project manager and top management.

<div></div><div></div>Its all about motivating each others and not just push to the stingies. No one likes it that way. It all comes to motivations within ourselves. To do!

<div></div><div></div>At times to bring all the motivations together they have the team motivators may be called people’s champion or sometimes the hr.

<div></div>And you have a motivated team as a company. – a product.

- *The author is specifically talking about Software development startup in general.*
