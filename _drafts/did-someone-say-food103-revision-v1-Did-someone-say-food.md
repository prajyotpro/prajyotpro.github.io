All of my friends keep asking me why donâ€™t I have a food post on my blog? I cook, I eat and try food at different places. Then why? â€¦

The world is huge, with so many people, each one of them having different style of cooking, experience and tastes.

Thought Iâ€™ll start with something which creates happiness (cooking food), and share my own experience and photo of some dishes Iâ€™ve cooked.

Yes, I cook at times. On weekends mostly, it makes me feel so good because I create something I love to eat. And I think it is a basic thing every body should do, to survive or to feel good.

The motivation comes from my late grandmother, she used to wake up early morning to make breakfast for all. I remember, on Sunday s I used to beat egg, mixed with veggies and stuff for my breakfast and wait till she pours it on sizzling frying pan. It was like a magic that times and is still a magic trick with loads if taste buds which makes you smile every time you take a bite.

Cooking is just a basic thing, all moms know. I can only imagine kitchen as my lab for experiments. Haha! Yeah, like experimenting different dishes. Sometimes it fails and at time it is a hit! But every time you learn to have fun.

I like to cook because I want to eat something which I would love to eat. But then sometimes I end up surprising myself with delicious, melting.. yaaaammm!
