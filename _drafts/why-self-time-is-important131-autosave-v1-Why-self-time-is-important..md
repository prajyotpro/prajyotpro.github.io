<span style="font-weight: 400;">**Time** spent on yourself makes you learn, grow and develop in a way you want. It is self **care**, it is self **love**. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been more than **4 years** I’ve been working as a **Software Developer**. So here I write with my own personal experiences about how I **balance** my daily life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first started working as a Software Developer my main goals were to learn how to be a **professional**. What I meant by being professional is following defined standards of working and writing code. First 2 years of my work experience had a steep learning curve. As a junior developer I was learning to write strict, optimised and flexible **code**. But learning how to write a software code with a given guidance was very important. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My work timing used to start from **9:00** to **18:00**, but I used to stay late putting more effort to get things right. Then it was very much needed for me to be at the level where I wanted to be, to achieve my personal goals (and companies as well).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe everyone has a potential to achieve their **targets**, sometimes slow, at times fast – practise, stress, healing makes us stronger – It is the way of **life**. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But then just work, like working at the table whole day got me **fat**. I gained almost **91 kgs** – that is the max I’ve been till now. I felt heavy, not so flexible, yet I used to insist writing flexible code, but that didn’t help my body. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me tell you guys – I used to play a lot of sports when in college and university. I represented my college in table tennis, cricket. Also a basketball and football enthusiast. And hell yeah! I used to workout. But then I had to play my priority games once I started working.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s the deal now? Interestingly, I try to follow my daily routine. It is necessary to keep your body and mind clean and fit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically it consist of nothing special, just a strict and focused plan. </span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wake up at 7 – without your phone.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshen up – keep your mind relaxed – close your eyes and relax for a minute. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the coffee and breakfast ready. My breakfast feels incomplete without eggs. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">I leave for work by 9:20 (it takes 5 mins for me to travel to my current workplace)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh you need to read my post on what I like to do at work – </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Also I try to leave my work on time now, but then it also depends on the workload. So max by 19:00.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Go home, feel fresh take a shot of coffee and fire the gym.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Be back home by 21:00-21:30. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshen up – Cook my dinner – now this is the best part of the day. Very decisive and something to feel good about ending the day, cause love food. And I believe you love it too.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before bed I try to spend my time on research, reading or social – it depends on what’s active.</span>

Joining gym, staying healthy &amp; fit not only boosted my health, but also made be feel confident about my self in every approach of life. Now I weigh **75 kg** (healthy). I feel good about my body, I feel good about my self. “**I love myself**” – is what we all want to achieve in life, isn’t it ?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That sums up my day. Oh yes! I love **weekends**. That’s the time I like to meet people, take chill on a beach, go swimming, may be cycling – lots of activities to do. And we need to make time for it</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you plan you day? Tell me about it in comments.</span>
